</ul>
<h4>Other changes</h4>

<h3>v9.53</h3>
<h4>Code Remarks</h4>
<p>v9.53 code is the same as v9.52's. The only change it does is <strong>change whitespace from tabs to 4 spaces</strong> to apply
the same standard for the entire source code.</p>
<p>Those who forked the <em>KF-ScrnBalance</em> repository should do the following procedure to avoid merge conflicts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Merge <code>v9.52</code> <strong>tag</strong> into your branch.</li>
<li>Replace tabs with 4 spaces within your code (&quot;\t&quot; -&gt; &quot;    &quot;) and commit changes to your branch.</li>
<li>Merge <code>v9.53</code> <strong>tag</strong> into your branch. Resolve any conflicts.</li>
<li>Merge <code>master</code> into your branch.</li>
</ol>
<h3>v9.52</h3>
<h4>ScrN Waves</h4>
<h6>Ammo Grab Waves</h6>
<p>Set <code>EndRule=RULE_GrabAmmo</code> to force players looking for ammo boxes. Wave ends when the given amount of ammo boxes are
picked up. Useful to make players replenish their ammo pools without opening the trader.</p>
<h6>Dosh Grab Waves</h6>
<p>Dead zeds drop dosh on the ground instead of adding it to player/team wallet. It is like using <em>ScrnDoshGrab</em> mutator
but those could be only a few waves instead of the entire game. Wave ends when the given amount of dosh is collected.
There are two wave kinds: <code>RULE_DoshGrab</code> and <code>RULE_GrabDoshZed</code>. The difference between those two is that in
<code>RULE_GrabDoshZed</code> <strong>zeds can pick dosh</strong> to heal or boost their health (up to x5 of the original hp).</p>
<p>Dosh drop kind depends from the kill shot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dosh is tossed toward player if killed by a headshot;</li>
<li>Dosh is thrown up if killed by fire, explosive and other damages that can't do headshots;</li>
<li>Dosh is &quot;farted out&quot; if killed by bodyshot.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Squad Scale</h6>
<p>Added &quot;Scale squad members by player count&quot; feature (<em>Squad Scale</em>) to squad definition in <code>ScrnWaveInfo</code>.
For example, <code>SpecialSquads=~6: BOSS</code> means an extra boss will be added for each 6 players starting with 7th (6+1);
health of the <strong>entire squad</strong> will be matched to player count instead of every zed:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 player : 1 boss, 1p hp</li>
<li>2 players: 1 boss, 2p hp</li>
<li>6 players: 1 boss, 6p hp</li>
<li>7 players: 2 bosses, 3.5p hp each</li>
<li>8 players: 2 bosses, 4p hp each</li>
<li>9 players: 2 bosses, 4.5p hp each</li>
<li>10 players: 2 bosses, 5p hp each</li>
<li>11 players: 2 bosses, 5.5p hp each</li>
<li>12 players: 2 bosses, 6p hp each</li>
<li>13 players: 3 bosses, 4.33p hp each (13/3)</li>
<li>18 players: 3 bosses, 6p hp each</li>
<li>20 players: 4 bosses, 3.33p hp each</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Squad Scale</em> can be applied for regular squads as well, e.g. <code>Squad=~3: SC</code> spawns an extra Scrake
per each 3 players in the team (every Scrake in this case won't have more than 3p health).</p>
<h6>Other changes</h6>
<ul>
<li><code>BountyScale</code> now is applied on both player reward and team budget (previously it was applied only on team budget)</li>
<li><code>BountyScale</code>, in addition, can be set for each wave (overrides game's value)</li>
<li>Inverted <code>SpawnRateMod</code>setting to avoid further confusion. From now on <code>SpawnRateMod=2.0</code> means twice <em>faster</em> spawns
while <code>SpawnRateMod=0.5</code> - twice <em>slower</em>. <strong>Make sure to update ScrnWaves.ini !</strong></li>
<li><code>bRandomSquads</code> and <code>bRandomSpecialSquads</code> - allows turning off a random component for more predictable game.</li>
<li><code>GameTitle</code> - games (ScrnGameLength) can have a name now (shown on the scoreboard)</li>
</ul>
<h4>TSC: Team Survival Competition</h4>
<ul>
<li>Killing members of the other team gives $+100</li>
<li>Killing teammates charges $-100</li>
</ul>
<h4>FTG: Follow The Guardian</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Stinky Clot got raped by a Shiver and now gained an ability to teleport... when stuck</li>
</ul>
<h4>Mystery Game</h4>
<ul>
<li>Wave2, Earn Dosh, split on three: Earn Dosh, Grab Dosh and Zed Grab Dosh.</li>
<li>Added Ammo Grab wave between Wave 9 and Wave 10.</li>
<li>Now there are 13 waves in the Mystery Game.</li>
<li>Balance improvements.</li>
</ul>
<h4>(<strong>New</strong>) Half-Long Game</h4>
<p>Five-wave game containing 4 latest waves from the Long game and new brand-new introduction wave (Dosh Grab)</p>
<h4>(<strong>New</strong>) Small Big Zeds</h4>
<p>Six-wave game where Big zeds (Husk+) have less health, but there are bigger in numbers. For example, in 6-player
Small Big Zeds game there will be 3 Scrake spawning (each having 2p health) instead of one with 6p health, unlike
in regular game.</p>
<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
<ul>
<li>Yet another attempt to fix client crash while opening ScrN Features tab...</li>
<li>Fixed Dual Flare Revolver ammo price</li>
<li>Fixed an issue when Machete was falling though some objects</li>

<li>Chainsaw fuel capacity slightly raised to 105 to add some reserve for idle consumption</li>

first games without instantly getting wiped again and again until rage-quit. From now on Normal
difficulty is considered easy, Hard - Normal, Suicidal - Hard, Hell on Earth - the game it meant to

<h2>Gunslinger PERK</h2>
<p>New perk supposed to use pistols, especially in Dual mode.
To enable Gunslinger perk you need to add it to the <em>ServerPerks.ini</em>.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Buying perked duals -&gt; selling offperk&quot;</em> exploit fully fixed only in the
ScrN versions of the pistols.</p>
<p>Single pistols are still better in Sharpshooter hands, because he has both base
and perk headshot damage multiplier (up to 140% bonus for level 6).
Gunslinger has only up to 50% damage bonus, but it's applied to the bodyshots
too. Both single and dual 9mm damage bonus is limited to 35%.</p>
<p>Dual pistols are no longer Sharpshooter weapons - he can't level up with them
and doesn't have any damage/reload/recoil bonuses. However, trader discount
bonus is still applied to prohibit potential buying/selling exploits.</p>
<p>Weight modifications were made:</p>
<pre><code>Dual-9mm        2 blocks
44 Magnum       3 blocks
Dual 44 Magnum  4 blocks
HandCannon      4 blocks
Dual HC         5 blocks
Laser 44 Magnum 5 blocks (new weapon)
</code></pre>
<p>Because all Gunslinger perk inventory is light-weight, his max carry weight
is limited to 10.</p>
<p>Magnum44 ammo price lowered from 13 to 12 to match HC per-bullet price.
Magnum44 bullet now is slightly cheaper than HC and that is how it's supposed to be.</p>
<p>Dual HC/44 are put in Gunslinger's weapon slot 3. Other perks still will
have them in slot 2. This is made because usually Gunslinger has too many
pistols in slot 2 and it is compilated to switch between them.</p>
<h3>COWBOY MODE</h3>
<p>Starting from level 3 Gunslinger can act in Cowboy mode.
Cowboys use only dual pistols, can't wear armor or use laser sights.
Cowboy mode is switching automatically when all the requirements are met.</p>
<p>Cowboy mode grants Gunslinger following bonuses:</p>
<ul>
<li>25% extra reload bonus for each level (up to 75%)</li>
<li>5% speed bonus for each next level (up to 20%)</li>
<li>10% fire rate bonus for each next level (up to 30%)</li>
</ul>
